# Telecom Churn Analysis

## Overview
In the ever-changing world of telecom, understanding and tackling customer churn is crucial. This project focuses on the unique telecom market of India and Southeast Asia. I have explored the different models used by customers and aim to predict when they might leave our services.

## Understanding Churn
I started by figuring out why and how customers decide to leave. There are different ways to define this, especially for customers who pay before using the services. This project will mainly focus on those customers.

## Definitions of Churn
Churn can mean different things. For this analysis, it's about customers who stop using the services. I have analysed patterns and behaviors to predict when this might happen.

## High-Value Churn
Since most of the revenue comes from a small group of customers, i have concentrated on them & found out who they are and predict if they might leave. Defination high-value customers as follows: Those who have recharged with an amount more than or equal to X, where X is the 70th percentile of the average recharge amount in the first two months (the good phase).

## Business Objective and Data
The main goal is to predict if customers will leave in the future using data from the past.There is information about customers for four months, and the need is to predict what happens in the last month.

## Dataset &  Data Dictionary
Dataset has 99,999 rows & 226 features. There's a list explaining what different words mean in the dataset. Such acronyms from the datset has been explained in the data dictionary file.

## Approach
- Reading & Understanding Dataset
- Data Wrangaling
- Data Vizualization
- Dat Preparation
- Model Building
- Model Evaluation & Prediction

## Conclusion and Recommendations
The pointer & insights is extensive to be discussed here.Therefore, conclusion & reccomendation has been enclosed inside jupyte notebook.Kinldy refer the notebook.
I urge the stakeholders to keep these point in mind before taking any decison regarding business.
